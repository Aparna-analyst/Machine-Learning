## **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis**  

#### **Objective of the study**  
The objective of this study is to build a predictive model using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to estimate the Highway mpg (miles per gallon) of a car based on various features such as engine specifications, dimensions, transmission type, and fuel type.

#### **Problem Statement**  
Fuel efficiency is a critical factor in car manufacturing, customer decision-making, and environmental impact assessment. Accurate prediction of a car's highway mpg can help:

- Automobile manufacturers improve engine designs and optimize vehicle aerodynamics.
- Consumers make informed decisions when selecting fuel-efficient vehicles.
- Policy makers and environmental agencies assess and regulate fuel efficiency standards to reduce carbon emissions.
  
Given the increasing demand for fuel-efficient vehicles, predicting highway mpg is essential to ensure more efficient and environmentally friendly automotive solutions.
